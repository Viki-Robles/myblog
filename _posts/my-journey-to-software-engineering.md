I worked in sales for three years, and I must admit that whilst it was fun to begin with, in the end, I knew it wasnâ€™t for me. For over a year I tried different options, such as copywriting, to discover what I wanted to do with my career â€“ I started a blog with various articles but again, I knew it wasnâ€™t for me.

I really wanted to do something that I love and something that I would be proud of.

During that time a friend of mine who is a data scientist inspired me to start learning python and so I started coding on DataCamp and other online resources, reading books but I still felt that there was something missing.

I got in touch with Kodiri Bootcamp and I joined the part-time cohort where I was going three times per week after work. I was really determined, and I realized that this was something I really enjoyed. I am not going to lie, the first weeks were really hard - especially when you see big red error messages on the screen for the first time â€“ and you think to yourself, â€˜what I am doing?â€™.

Later in the year I joined the full-time cohort, which was the best choice I had made so far. Having achieved that and with some projects under my belt I thought, â€˜Now is the time to get out there and start looking for your first dev role!â€™.

However, the pandemic arrived to mess up my plans. It was hard to land that first job until I finally met the crew from Digital Futures and my journey as a Frontend Engineer started.

Since then, my experience has been excellent, and I feel lucky to have the support and guidance of my colleagues. I really liked the vision of Digital Futures before I joined, and their mission to bring the engineers of the future in the market through their Academy. Our vision is to have an impact in society and make sure candidates like you will be offered a unique opportunity in tech and grow.

Being a software engineer can change peopleâ€™s lives, you can share how you see the world through your code â€“ you can create or build anything you really want.

At times, it feels like a superpower but letâ€™s not forget, it is really hard work and lots of reading.

Getting into tech is challenging but also super exciting and fun!

And if I did it then you can too.

Just keep coding and it will come.
